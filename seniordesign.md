### Senior Design

# Project outline
The goal of the project was to meet the needs of our customer and company collaborator Hansen Medical. We successful meet and excited the needs of Hansen Medical. The fixture we developed did not compromise the accuracy of their current manufacturing process while improving the ease of use and decreasing the amount of time needed to complete the process. This was accomplished by creating a fixture that used a Mountz EZ-glider torque arm as a support structure for the braking and sensor components. The arm makes it easy for the technician to position and align the fixture. The torque was applied by magnetic particle brake which was measured by a torque sensor and used by our computer program to control the torque being applied to ensure the accuracy of the fixture. Included with the hardware of the fixture a software program was developed in LabVIEW to enable the use of the various components, a control system and user interface. The program was developed for Hansen a means for them reduce technician interaction during testing and increase the amount of information collected during testing. We were also able to in parallel with torque test run another test on their fixture. The ROM test was done separately during their manufacturing and maintenance testing however we were able to run both tests at the same time.

This project was a collaboration with Hansen medical and the project entailed not only us building the fixture for them but accessing their needs. We determined what it is they needed and accessed our ability to meet those needs. The fixture we developed not was developed as a solution to their current manufacturing process but has capabilities to used on future systems as well can easily be adapted to other purposes. These are added benefits we were able to provide to Hansen medical.
